## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AlgoSearch.git
cd AlgoSearch

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

```

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Search Query**: User enters search terms in the search bar
2. **TF-IDF Processing**: Backend processes query using TF-IDF algorithm
3. **Results Ranking**: Results are ranked by relevance
4. **Display**: Results show problem name, platform, difficulty level, and direct links

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy from project directory
vercel
```

Or connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on every push.
